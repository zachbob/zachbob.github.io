			<h2>Digital Content Developer</h2>
			<p>As a carpenter I learned to measure twice, cut once and build for the long-term. As a standup comedian I engage diverse audiences with original content. Combine the two and my winding path suddenly clarifies itself. I am a developer who builds solutions that are creative, concise and enduring.

			<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>I am a passionate learner who's allergic to phony bologna. When I was very young I dropped out of several prestigious universities including the University of Wisconsin - Madison, Beijing University and the University of MN - Twin Cities. While I'm not necessarily proud of the fact that I never finished college I'm not ashamed of it either. I believe that there are two types of people in the world, those who know what they're doing and those who don't. In my professional learning I strive to be in the former category whenever possible, and to acknowledge the fact when I am not.</p>
